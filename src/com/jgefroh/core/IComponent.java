 * The interface for a {@code Component}.

 * A {@code Component} holds all of the data needed for a specific feature
 * or function. The data in a {@code Component} is manipulated by 
 * {@code Systems} through {@code InfoPacks}.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * As a rule, {@code Components} should not contain any logic. They should be
 * entirely data. The only methods a {@code Component} should have are
 * accessor methods (getters/setters) to retrieve its data and appropriate
 * constructors and initializers.
