/**
 * Interface for an {@code InfoPack}.
 * 
 * <p>
 * An {@code InfoPack} is intended to provide a {@code System} access 
 * to data held in a {@code component} via accessor methods 
 * (getters/setters). They group together one or more {@code Components}
 * that contain data needed by a {@code System}.
 * <br>
 * <br>
 * It is also intended to control whether a {@code System} will process an 
 * {@code Entity} through its presence or lack of presence.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * {@code Core} automatically calls a method to generate an {@code InfoPack} 
 * within its accompanying {@code IInfoPackFactory}.
 * </p>
